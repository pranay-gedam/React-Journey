# 📅 Day 5 – Conditional Rendering, Rendering Lists & map() Function

## 📘 What I Learned

- **Conditional Rendering**:
  - Using `if`, `else`, and ternary operators to render UI based on conditions.
  - Using `&&` operator for short-circuit rendering.
  - Best practices to avoid too many nested conditions.

- **Rendering Lists**:
  - Displaying multiple elements from an array in JSX.
  - The importance of using a **unique `key` prop** for list items.

- **map() Function in JSX**:
  - Iterating over arrays to dynamically generate UI elements.
  - Returning JSX elements from `.map()` for rendering lists.

🧠 Key Takeaways
Conditional rendering controls what appears on screen based on state or props.
The map() function is essential for dynamic list rendering.
Always use unique keys for list items to improve performance and avoid warnings.
