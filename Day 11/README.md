# Day 11 - useMemo Hook in React

## 📌 Topics Covered
- What is **useMemo** and why it’s useful
- Difference between **useMemo** and **useEffect**
- Memoization to optimize expensive calculations
- Preventing unnecessary re-renders
- Dependency array and how it controls memoization

## 📝 Key Notes
- `useMemo` caches the result of a function so it doesn’t re-run on every render  
- Syntax:  
  ```jsx
  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
