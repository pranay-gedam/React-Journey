# Day 7 - Event Handling in React

## 📌 Topics Covered
- Understanding the concept of event handling in React
- Differences between HTML event handling and React's synthetic events
- Passing event handlers as props
- Binding `this` in class components (brief overview)
- Handling events in functional components
- Passing arguments to event handlers

## 📝 Key Notes
- In React, event names are written in **camelCase** instead of lowercase.
- Event handlers in JSX are passed as **functions**, not strings.
- React uses a concept called **Synthetic Events**, which is a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event.
- Common events:  
  - `onClick`
  - `onChange`
  - `onSubmit`
  - `onMouseEnter` / `onMouseLeave`
