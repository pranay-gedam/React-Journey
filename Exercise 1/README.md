# 📅 Day 6 – Fetching API Data & Displaying as Cards (Exercise)

Problem - Use an api and display the data in the form of a card under a container. All the data points returned by the API should be converted to a card Use this API: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

## 📘 What I Learned

- **Fetching data from an API** using `fetch()` in JavaScript.
- **Displaying dynamic data** in React by mapping over an array.
- Creating a **Card component** to present data in a clean, reusable format.
- Handling **asynchronous code** with `useEffect` to fetch data on component mount.
- Understanding API data structure and how to access specific fields.

🧠 Key Takeaways
useEffect is perfect for running code when the component mounts, like API calls.
Always handle errors in API calls to avoid crashes.
Mapping over API data allows creating dynamic UIs easily.
Breaking UI into small reusable components (like PostCard) keeps code clean.
