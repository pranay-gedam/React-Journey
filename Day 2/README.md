# 📅 Day 2 – Components, Props, and JSX

## 📘 What I Learned

- **Components**:
  - Building **functional components** in React.
  - Understanding the importance of reusable components.
  - File and naming conventions for components.

- **Props (Properties)**:
  - Passing data from a **parent component** to a **child component**.
  - Using **props** inside a component to make it dynamic.
  - Default props and destructuring props.

- **JSX**:
  - Embedding JavaScript expressions inside JSX using `{}`.
  - Differences between JSX and HTML (e.g., `className` instead of `class`).
  - Using props inside JSX for dynamic rendering.


🧠 Key Takeaways
Components make your code modular and easier to maintain.

Props allow data reusability and dynamic rendering.

JSX is JavaScript + XML-like syntax, not plain HTML.
